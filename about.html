                <p class="p1">Trevor Bailey was born on October 21, 1997 in Jupiter, FL. He spent his
                    childhood living in Jupiter, then moving to Orlando, FL in August of 2017. As of now, he
                    is a stock clerk at a local Publix grocery store, but is currently working on turning one of
                    his hobbies of playing escape rooms into his own business of running an escape room
                    company. Though Trevor has a huge passion for escape rooms, he also has many other
                    passions that he spends his free time with.</p>

                <p class="p2">Trevor is an avid roller coaster enthusiast where he travels the country going to
                    different theme parks and amusement parks in order to ride every roller coaster he can.
                    Not only does he like riding roller coasters, but he likes designing them too, using K’nex
                    building pieces and playing roller coaster computer simulation games. When he is not
                    out riding or designing roller coasters, he is out busy collecting model trains for his train
                    collection.</p>

                <p class="p3">Model trains are another passion of Trevor’s that started ever since he was a
                    child. He has a wide variety of different model trains, specifically focussing on G-scale
                    model trains.
                    As a junior in high school, Trevor was a part of First Robotics, a program where
                    different schools compete in yearly robotic building challenges. He led his team to
                    victory in the finals competition, a first for his school, beating out 64 other teams.
                    Trevor plans to continue focusing on building his escape room business, working
                    on the storyboarding and various themed rooms he has planned for the business.</p>
